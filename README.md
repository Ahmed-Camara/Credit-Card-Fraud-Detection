# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The goal for this task is to predict whether  a credit card is fraud or not using Machine Learning.
The dataset is highly highly unbalanced which will be a problem when we will try to make a prediction. We used the random over sampling method to balance the data, and then apply the different algorithms.
